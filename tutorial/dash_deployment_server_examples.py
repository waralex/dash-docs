    In Plotly Enterprise 2.4.0 and above, you can deploy your apps using
    either HTTPS or SSH. If you are deploying with HTTPS, then you do not
    need to set up an SSH key. Thus, you can skip this tutorial and go
    straight to
    [Initialize Dash Apps on Dash Deployment Server](/dash-deployment-server/initialize).

    &nbsp;

    If you are deploying with SSH then you need to add a SSH Key to the
    Dash Deployment Server. SSH Keys are used to authenticate your git
    session with the server. Deploying with SSH takes a little bit more
    time to set up but it allows you to deploy without typing in your
    username and password each time. Continue below for instructions on
    how to generate and add a SSH Key.

    #### Why Deploy with SSH?

    We recommend deploying with HTTPS for most of our users.
    However, if your Dash Deployment Server is using a **self-signed
    certificate**, deploying with HTTPS
    [requires some extra, challenging configuration](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11621768/).
    In these cases, it will be easier to set up deploying with SSH.

    ***

    #### Already Have an SSH Key?

    If you already have an SSH key that you've used in other
    services, you can use that key instead of generating a new one.
    For instructions on how to add an existing SSH Key to the Dash Deployment
    Server, jump to **Copy and Add SSH Key**.

    To deploy dash apps to the Dash Deployment Server, there
    are a few files required for successful deployment. Below is a common

    ## Folder Reference

    ```
    Dash_App/
    |-- assets/
       |-- app.css
    |-- app.py
    |-- .gitignore
    |-- Procfile
    |-- requirements.txt
    |-- runtime.txt
    ```

    ***

    ## Files Reference

    `app.py`

    This is the entry point to your application, it contains your Dash app code.
    This file must contain a line that defines the `server` variable:
    ```server = app.server```

    ***

    `.gitignore`

    Determines which files and folders are ignored in git, and therefore
    ignored (i.e. not copied to the server) when you deploy your application.
    An example of its contents would be:

    ```
    venv
    *.pyc
    .DS_Store
    .env
    ```

    ***

    `Procfile`

    Declares what commands are run by app's containers. This is commonly,
    ```web: gunicorn app:server --workers 4``` where app refers to the file
    `app.py` and server refers to the variable named server inside that file.
    gunicorn is the web server that will run your application, make sure to
    add this in your requirements.txt file.

    ***

    `requirements.txt`

    Describes the app's python dependencies. For example,

    ```
    dash==0.21.1
    dash-auth==1.0.1
    dash-renderer==0.11.3
    dash-core-components==0.22.1
    dash-html-components==0.9.0
    ```

    ***

    `runtime.txt`

    This file specifies python runtime. For example, its contents would be
    `python-2.7.15` or `python-3.6.6`.

    ***

    `assets`

    An optional folder that contains CSS stylesheets, images, or
    custom JavaScript files. [Learn more about assets](/external-resources).

    a convention like using the name of your application and adding `-redis`
    to the end, e.g. `my-dash-app-redis`.

    In Dash Deployment Server, Dash Apps are run in isolated containers.
    Dash Deployment Server builds the entire system for each individual app
    from scratch, including installing a fresh instance of Python, installing
    dependencies, and more. This isolation and containerization is great: it
    allows for one app's dependencies to not impact the next app's and,
    from a security perspective, ensures that applications can't modify or
    access the underlying server. One part of this isolation is that each app
    has its own "ephemeral" filesystem. This means that:

    - By default, files that are saved in the app's environment aren't
    persisted across deploys.
    - By default, files (even networked file systems) that are on the actual
    physical server aren't actually accessible to the application.

    &nbsp;

    Starting in Plotly Enterprise 2.5.0, you can map filesystems from the
    underlying server into the application. This allows you to save files
    persistently as well as read files from the underlying server, including
    networked file systems.

    Since this feature has security implications, only users with
    admin/superuser privileges are allowed to map directories onto apps.
    Before you get started, ask your current administrator to grant you
    admin/superuser privileges as shown below.

    ***

    #### Add Admin/Superuser Privileges

    As administrator, navigate to the admin panel
    `https://<your.plotly.domain>/admin/` and select **Users**. From the list
    of users, select the user you wish to edit. Next, check both the
    **Staff status** and **Superuser status** box to give the user
    admin/superuser privileges, which will allow the user to map
    directories onto apps.

    ***

    #### Recommendations

    If you are mounting a filesystem, we have the following recommendations:

    - Try to isolate the data that you need into its own, app-specific folder
    - Do not mount the entire filesystem
    - Do not mount system directories, like those under `/usr`.
    - As per the
    ["Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard),
    folders inside the `/srv` folder would be a good, conventional place
    to host app level data.
    - This feature also works with networked filesystems. Note that this
    requires some extra configuration in the underlying server by your
    server administrator. In particular, the network filesystem should be
    added to the `/etc/fstab` file on the underlying server. For more
    information, see this
    [RHEL7 and CentOS documentation on CIFS and NFS](https://www.certdepot.net/rhel7-mount-unmount-cifs-nfs-network-file-systems/)
    , the official [Ubuntu NFS documentation](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/network-file-system.html.en),
