        In this example, the callback function is fired whenever any of the

        Try it for yourself by entering data in the inputs above.

        `dash.dependencies.State` allows you to pass along extra values without
        firing the callbacks. Here's the same example as above but with the
        `dcc.Input` as `dash.dependencies.State` and a button as
        `dash.dependencies.Input`.

        In this example, changing text in the `dcc.Input` boxes won't fire
        the callback but clicking on the button will. The current values of
        the `dcc.Input` values are still passed into the callback even though
        they don't trigger the callback function itself.

        Note that we're triggering the callback by listening to the
        `n_clicks` property of the `html.Button` component. `n_clicks` is a
        property that gets incremented every time the component has been
        clicked on. It is available in every component in the
        `dash_html_components` library.
