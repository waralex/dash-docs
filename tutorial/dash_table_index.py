    >
    > Dash DataTable is an interactive table component designed for
    > viewing, editing, and exploring large datasets.
    >
    > DataTable is rendered with standard, semantic HTML `<table/>` markup,
    > which makes it accessible, responsive, and easy to style.
    >
    > This component was written from scratch in React.js specifically
    > for the Dash community. Its API was designed to be ergonomic
    > and its behavior is completely customizable through its properties.
    >
    > 7 months in the making, this is the most complex Dash
    > component that Plotly has written, all from the ground-up
    > using React and TypeScript. DataTable was designed with a
    > featureset that allows that Dash users to create complex,
    > spreadsheet driven applications with no compromises.
    > We're excited to continue to work with users and companies
    > that [invest in DataTable's future](https://plot.ly/products/consulting-and-oem/).
    >
    > DataTable is in `Alpha`. This is more of a statement on the
    > DataTable API rather than on its features.
    > The table currently works beautifully and is already
    > used in production at F500 companies. However, we
    > expect to make a few more breaking changes to its API and
    > behavior within the next couple of months.
    > Once the community feels good about its API, we'll lock it down
    >  and we'll commit to reducing the frequency of breaking changes.
    > Please subscribe to [dash-table#207](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/issues/207)
    > and the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) to stay up-to-date with any breaking changes.
    >
    > So, check out DataTable and let us know what you think.
    > Or even better, share your DataTable Dash apps
    > on the [community forum](https://community.plot.ly/t/show-and-tell-community-thread/7554)!

            '/datatable/sizing',
            '''
            All about sizing the DataTable. Examples include:
            - Setting the width and the height of the table
            - Responsive table design
            - Setting the widths of individual columns
            - Handling long text
            - Fixing rows and columns

        Chapter('Part 2. Styling',
            '/datatable/style',
            '''
            The style of the DataTable is highly customizable. This chapter
            includes examples for:
            - Conditional formatting
            - Displaying multiple rows of headers
            - Highlighting rows, columns, and cells
            - Styling the table as a list view
            - Changing the colors (including a dark theme!)

            The sizing API for the table has been particularly tricky for
            us to nail down, so be sure to read this chapter to understand the nuances,
            limitations, and the APIs that we're exploring.

        Chapter('Part 3. Sorting, Filtering, Selecting, and Paging',
            '/datatable/interactivity',
            '''
            The DataTable is interactive. This chapter demonstrates the
            interactive features of the table and how to wire up these
            interations to Python callbacks. These actions include:
            - Paging
            - Selecting Rows
            - Sorting Columns
            - Filtering Data

            '/datatable/callbacks',
            '''
            In Part 3, the paging, sorting, and filtering was done entirely
            clientside (in the browser). This means that you need to
            load all of the data into the table up-front. If your data is large,
            then this can be prohibitively slow.

            In this chapter, you'll learn how to write your own filtering,
            sorting, and paging backends in Python with Dash.
            We'll do the data processing with Pandas but you could write your
            own routines with SQL or even generate the data on the fly!

            In this chapter, you'll learn how to configure the table to
            - assign the column type
            - change the data presentation
            - change the data formatting
            - validate or coerce user data input
            - apply default behavior for valid and invalid data

            '/datatable/editable',
            '''
            The DataTable is editable. Like a spreadsheet, it can be used
            as an input for controlling models with a variable number
            of inputs.

            This chapter includes recipes for:

            - Determining which cell has changed
            - Filtering out null values
            - Adding or removing columns
            - Adding or removing rows
            - Ensuring that a minimum set of rows are visible
            - Running Python computations on certain columns or cells

            Cells can be rendered as editable Dropdowns. This is our first
            stake in bringing a full typing system to the table.
            Rendering cells as dropdowns introduces some complexity in the
            markup and so there are a few limitations that you should be aware
            of.
