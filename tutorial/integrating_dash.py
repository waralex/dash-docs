    # Embedding Dash within existing web applications

    This section describes three different approaches to embedding a Dash app
    within an existing web application.
    
    ## Using an `<iframe>`

    Perhaps the simplest approach to embedding Dash in an existing web
    application is to an include an `<iframe>` element in your HTML whose `src`
    attribute points towards the address of an already running Dash
    instance. This allows you to place your Dash app in a specific location
    within an existing web page, with your desired dimensions:""")),

    ## Embedding a Dash app within an existing Flask app 
    
    As discussed in the [Deployment Chapter](/deployment), Dash uses the Flask
    web framework under the hood. It is possible to take advantage of this and
    embed a Dash app at a specific route of an existing Flask app. In the
    following example, a Dash app is mounted at the `/dash` route (eg
    `http://localhost:8050/dash`) of a Flask app:""")),

    ## Combining Dash apps with existing WSGI apps

    This approach uses Werkzeug's
    [`DispatcherMiddleware`](http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/docs/latest/middlewares/)
    to combine one or more Dash apps with one more existing WSGI apps. Unlike
    the previous approach, your existing web apps don't have to be built on
    Flask, but instead can be any Python web application implementing the [WSGI
    specification](https://wsgi.readthedocs.io).

    The following example illustrates this approach. In this example, the
    existing app being combined with two Dash apps is a Flask app, however it
    could be [any WSGI

    In this example, the Flask app has been mounted at `/` and the two Dash apps
    have been mounted at `/app1` and `/app2`. In this approach, we do not pass
    in a Flask server to the Dash apps, but let them create their own, which the
    `DispatcherMiddleware` routes requests to based on the prefix of the
    incoming requests. Within each Dash app, only `requests_pathname_prefix`
    must be provided with the app's mount point, as the mount points specified
    in the `DispatcherMiddleware` initialization has effectively already set
    `requests_pathname_prefix` with the correct value.

    Note that the `application` object in `wsgi.py` is of type
    `werkzeug.wsgi.DispatcherMiddleware`, which does not have a `run`
    method. This can be run as a WSGI app like so:

    ```
    $ gunicorn --reload wsgi:application
