    #### Generating HTML with Dash

    Dash apps are composed of two parts. The first part is the "`layout`" of
    the app and it describes what the application looks like.
    The second part describes the interactivity of the application.

    Dash provides Python classes for all of the visual components of
    the application. We maintain a set of components in the
    `dash_core_components` and the `dash_html_components` library
    but you can also [build your own](https://github.com/plotly/dash-components-archetype)
    with JavaScript and React.js.

    To get started, create a file named `app.py` with the following code:
    '''.replace('    ', '')),

    dcc.SyntaxHighlighter(
        examples[0][0],
        language='python',
        customStyle=styles.code_container
    ),
    dcc.Markdown('''
    Run the app with

    ```
    $ python app.py
    ...Running on http://127.0.0.1:8050/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
    ```

    and visit [http:127.0.0.1:8050/](http:127.0.0.1:8050/)
    in your web browser. You should see an app that looks like this.
    '''.replace('    ', '')),

    html.Div(examples[0][1], className="example-container"),

    # TODO - Comment about the default CSS of the graph?

    dcc.Markdown('''
        Note:
        1. The `layout` is composed of a tree of "components" like `html.Div`
           and `dcc.Graph`.
        2. The `dash_html_components` library has a component for every HTML
           tag. The `html.H1(children='Hello Dash')` component generates
           a `<h1>Hello Dash</h1>` HTML element in your application.
        3. Not all components are pure HTML. The `dash_core_components` describe
           higher-level components that are interactive and are generated with
           JavaScript, HTML, and CSS through the React.js library.
        4. Each component is described entirely through keyword attributes.
           Dash is _declarative_: you will primarily describe your application
           through these attributes.
        5. The `children` property is special. By convention, it's always the
           first attribute which means that you can omit it:
           `html.H1(children='Hello Dash')` is the same as `html.H1('Hello Dash')`.
           Also, it can contain a string, a number, a single component, or a
           list of components.
        6. The fonts in your application will look a little bit different than
           what is displayed here. This application is using a
           custom CSS stylesheet to modify the default styles of the elements.
           You can learn more in the [css tutorial](/dash/external-resources),
           but for now you can add `app.css.append_css({"external_url": "https://codepen.io/chriddyp/pen/bWLwgP.css"})`
           to your file to get the same look and feel of these examples.

    By default, the items in your layout are arranged one on top of the other.
    You can create different arrangements using CSS and stylesheets in the
    custom layout arrangements in Dash apps tutorial (coming soon!).

    #### More about HTML

    The `dash_html_components` library contains a component class for every
    HTML tag as well as keyword arguments for all of the HTML arguments.

    Let's customize the text in our app by modifying the inline styles of the
    components:
    '''.replace('    ', '')),

    dcc.SyntaxHighlighter(
        examples[1][0],
        language='python',
        customStyle=styles.code_container
    ),

    html.Div(examples[1][1], className="example-container", style={
        'padding-right': '35px',
        'padding-bottom': '30px'
    }),

    dcc.Markdown('''
        In this example, we modified the inline styles of the `html.Div`
        and `html.H1` components with the `style` property.

        `html.H1('Hello Dash', style={'textAlign': 'center', 'color': '#7FDFF'})`
        is rendered in the Dash application as
        `<h1 style="text-align: center; color: #7FDFF">Hello Dash</h1>`.

        There are a few important differences between the `dash_html_components`
        and the HTML attributes:
        1. The `style` property in HTML is a semicolon-separated string. In Dash,
           you can just supply a dictionary.
        2. The keys in the `style` dictionary are [camelCased](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case).
           So, instead of `text-align`, it's `textAlign`.
        3. The HTML `class` attribute is `className` in Dash.
        4. The children of the HTML tag is specified through the `children` keyword
           argument.

        Besides that, all of the available HTML attributes and tags are available
        to you within your Python context.

        ***

        #### Reusable Components

        By writing our markup in Python, we can create complex resuable
        components like tables without switching contexts or languages.

        Here's a quick example that generates a `Table` from a Pandas dataframe.
        If you don't have Pandas installed, install with `pip install pandas`.

    '''.replace('   ', '')),

    dcc.SyntaxHighlighter(
        examples[2][0],
        language='python',
        customStyle=styles.code_container
    ),

    html.Div(examples[2][1], className="example-container"),

    dcc.Markdown('''
        #### More about Visualization

        The `dash_core_components` library includes a component called `Graph`.

        `Graph` renders interactive data visualizations using the open source
        [plotly.js](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js) JavaScript graphing
        library. Plotly.js supports over 35 chart types and renders charts in
        both vector-quality SVG and high-performance WebGL.

        The `figure` argument in the `dash_core_components.Graph` component is
        the same `figure` argument that is used by `plotly.py`, Plotly's
        open source Python graphing library.
        Check out the [plotly.py documentation and gallery](https://plot.ly/python)
        to learn more.

    '''.replace('    ', '')),

    dcc.SyntaxHighlighter(
        examples[3][0],
        language='python',

    html.Div(examples[3][1], className="example-container"),

        #### Markdown

        While Dash exposes HTML through the `dash_html_components` library,
        it can be tedious to write your copy in HTML.
        For writing blocks of text, you can use the `Markdown` component in the
        `dash_core_components` library.

    dcc.Markdown('''
        #### Core Components

        The `dash_core_components` includes a set a higher-level components like
        dropdowns, graphs, markdown blocks, and more.

        Like all Dash components, they are described entirely declaratively.
        Every option that is configurable is available as a keyword argument
        of the component.

        We'll see many of these components throughout the tutorial.

        #### Calling `help`

        Dash components are declarative: every configurable aspect of these
        components is set during instantiation as a keyword argument.

        learn more about a component and its available arguments:

|  Dropdown is an interactive dropdown element for selecting one or more
|  items.

|  property and the selected item(s) are specified with the `value` property.

|  - value (string | list; optional): The value of the input. If `multi` is false (the default)
|  then value is just a string that corresponds to the values
|  provided in the `options` property. If `multi` is true, then

        ### Summary

        The `layout` of a Dash app describes what the app looks like.
        The `layout` is a hierarchical tree of components.
        The `dash_html_components` library provides classes for all of the HTML
        tags and the keyword arguments describe the HTML attributes like `style`,
        `className`, and `id`. The `dash_core_components` library
        generates higher-level components like controls and graphs.

        For reference, see:
        - [`dash_core_components` gallery](/dash/dash-core-components)
        - [`dash_html_components` reference](/dash/dash-html-components)

        The second part of the Dash tutorial covers how to make these apps
        interactive.
