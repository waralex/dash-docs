    ## Getting Started Example

    The [Dash Getting Started Guide](/getting-started) contains
    many applications that range in complexity.

    The first interactive app that you'll create combines a `Slider`
    with a `Graph` and filters data using a Pandas `DataFrame`.
    The `animate` property in the `Graph` component was set to `True`
    so that the points transition smoothly.
    Some interactivity is built-in to the `Graph` component including
    hovering over values, clicking on legend items to toggle traces, and
    zooming into regions.

    ## Oil and Gas Explorer

    This Dash app displays well data from New York State. As you hover over
    values in the map, a time series is displayed showing production values
    over time. As you change the years in the range slider, the aggregate
    time series is updated with the sum of all production over time.
    The histogram chart is also selectable, serving as an alternative
    control for selecting a range of time.

    This application is also mobile-friendly. Dash apps are built and
    published in the Web, so the full power of CSS is available.
    The Dash core team maintains a [core style guide here](https://codepen.io/chriddyp/pen/bWLwgP)
    that  includes a responsive 12 column grid.

    ## Dash DataTable

    Dash is currently incubating an interactive table component that provides
    built-in filtering, row-selection, editing, and sorting.
    Prototypes of this component are being developed in the
    [`dash-table-experiments`](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table-experiments)
    repository. Join the discussion in the
    [Dash Community Forum](https://community.plot.ly/t/display-tables-in-dash/4707/38).

    This example was written in ~100 lines of code.

    ## NYTimes Remake: Recession in 255 Charts

    485 lines of Python code, including text copy.

    This Dash app was adapted from NYTimes's excellent
    [How the Recession Reshaped the Economy in 255 Charts](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/06/05/upshot/how-the-recession-reshaped-the-economy-in-255-charts.html).

    This Dash app displays its content linearly, like an
    interactive report. The report highlights several notable
    views of the data and then invites the user to highlight
    their own regions at the end. This method of highlighting
    views is a great strategy for walking your readers through
    your complex analysis.

    The height of the charts was specified in viewport units (`vh`),
    scaling the size of the chart to the height of the screen. It
    looks great on monitors big and small.

    The text in the application is centered and its width is restricted
    to improve the reading experience. The graphs are full bleed:
    the extend past the narrow column of text the edges of page.
